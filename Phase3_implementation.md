# Phase 3 Implementation Plan: Visualization & Reporting

## Overview

Phase 3 focuses on implementing data visualization and reporting capabilities for the Telecom Tower Data Analysis Platform. Building upon data processing and AI integration from Phase 2, this phase enables users to visualize tower data, generate reports, and share insights with team members.

## Timeline

- **Duration**: Weeks 5-6 (2 weeks)
- **Components**: Chart components, report templates, export functionality, collaboration features

## Implementation Status

### Week 5: Data Visualization & Report Templates ✅

#### 1. Chart Components ✅
- **Base Visualization Components**: Created
  - `LineChart.vue` ✅
  - `BarChart.vue` ✅
  - `PieChart.vue` ✅
  - `DataTable.vue` ✅
- **Data Processing Utilities**: Implemented
  - `useChartData.ts` ✅
  - `useDataAggregation.ts` ✅

#### 2. Geographic Visualization ⚠️
- **Tower Location Map Component**:
  - Created `MapVisualization.vue` with partial Leaflet integration ⚠️
  - Map component structure created but functionality needs completion

#### 3. Report Templates ✅
- **Report Component System**: Created
  - `ReportBuilder.vue` ✅
  - `ReportSection.vue` ✅
  - `ReportViewer.vue` ✅
  - Templates:
    - `MonthlyPaymentReport.vue` ✅
    - `ContractExpiryReport.vue` ✅

### Week 6: Export Functions & Collaboration ⏳

#### 4. Export Functionality ⚠️
- **Export Components**: Partially implemented
  - Placeholder functions created in `ReportBuilder.vue` ⚠️
  - Actual export functionality pending implementation

#### 5. Report Management ❌
- **Database Schema Updates**: Not implemented
- **Report Pages**: Not implemented
  - Need to create:
    - `pages/reports/index.vue`
    - `pages/reports/create.vue`
    - `pages/reports/[id].vue`
    - `pages/reports/edit/[id].vue`

#### 6. Collaborative Features ❌
- **Sharing Capabilities**: Not implemented
- **Share Components**: Not implemented

## Next Steps

1. Complete `MapVisualization.vue` implementation:
   - Finalize Leaflet integration
   - Implement marker clustering
   - Add tooltip/popup functionality

2. Implement export functionality:
   - Complete PDF export in `ReportBuilder.vue`
   - Add Excel export capability
   - Implement image export

3. Create report management pages:
   - Implement report listing page
   - Create report creation workflow
   - Build report editing interface
   - Add report viewing page

4. Add collaborative features:
   - Implement report sharing functionality
   - Create access control for shared reports
   - Add commenting capability

5. Update database schema:
   - Add reports table
   - Create report_shares table

## Technical Implementation Details

The current implementation has successfully created the foundation for visualization and reporting with:

1. Chart components using Chart.js via vue-chartjs
2. Basic map implementation with Leaflet
3. Responsive report templates with component-based architecture
4. Data processing utilities for aggregation and transformation

The remaining work focuses on:
- Completing map functionality
- Implementing export capabilities
- Building report management interface
- Adding collaboration features

## Updated Timeline

- **Weeks 5-6**: Visualization components and report templates ✅
- **Weeks 7-8**: Export functionality, report management, and collaboration features ⏳
