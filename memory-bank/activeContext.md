# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is currently in **Phase 4 of implementation**, focusing on collaborative features and report sharing functionality. This phase builds upon the already implemented data import, validation, visualization, and basic reporting capabilities.

## Recent Changes

### Report Sharing Implementation
- New database migration for report shares (20250310_report_shares.sql)
- Implementation of API endpoints for report sharing:
  - `/api/reports/[id]/share.post.ts` - Share a report with users
  - `/api/reports/shared.get.ts` - Get shared reports
  - `/api/reports/shares/revoke.delete.ts` - Revoke report sharing

### Collaboration Features
- Components for managing report access and sharing:
  - `ReportAccess.vue` - Controls for viewing and managing report access
  - `ShareReport.vue` - Interface for sharing reports with other users

### Email Notifications
- Email notification API endpoint (`/api/notifications/email.post.ts`)
- Integration with report sharing workflow to notify users

## In-Progress Work
- Testing and validation of report sharing functionality
- Integration of email notifications with report sharing
- User interface refinements for collaboration features
- Performance optimization for shared report access

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. Complete testing of report sharing functionality
2. Enhance user permissions and access control for shared reports
3. Finalize email notification templates and delivery
4. Implement real-time updates for collaborative editing

### Upcoming Work
1. Enhanced export capabilities for shared reports
2. Batch operations for report management
3. Activity logging for shared content
4. Dashboard widgets for shared report visibility

## Active Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- Using database-based sharing permissions rather than file-system approach
- Implementing server-side access control checks for all shared resource access
- Separating sharing records from report data for flexibility

### UX Decisions
- Unified sharing interface across all report types
- Permission-based visibility of sharing controls
- Clear indicators of shared vs. private content
- Granular permission options (view, edit, share, export)

### Technical Considerations
- Database indexing strategy for efficient access control checks
- Caching approach for frequently accessed shared reports
- Rate limiting for sharing operations to prevent abuse
- Security measures for protecting sensitive shared data
